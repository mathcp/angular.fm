# Isobar Brazil Test

My test to apply for a front-end developer position in Isobar Brazil

Used technolog technologies

  - AngularJS 1.6
  - Gulp
  - Sass
  - Twitter Bootstrap (just for save time purpose)

### Installation

To run the project is very simple, you just need to download the dependencies, build the CSS and JS files and access your local URL for the project.

Before just make sure you have installed the node.js and also the Gulp task runner

```sh
$ npm install
$ gulp vendor
$ gulp watch
```

After all this done, just run the project on your local web server and enjoy.

### What I've done

I've used AngularJS for template creation, API integration and for the routing of list and detail screens.

For customization I've decided to use Sass to streamline the process and make the code more readable

The task runner I've used was Gulp, that choice was based only on convenience, it could have been Grunt as well.

### "Issues"

I didn't have time to finalize the desktop and tablet versions unfortunately due to commitments with my current job.
